# 2-高阶并发对象

## Lock Objects

- 和内置锁的工作方式类似
- 支持wait/notify机制
- 相比内置锁, 支持放弃获得某个锁
  - tryLock()
  - lockInterruptibly()
- 实现
  - ReentrantLock: 可重入锁
  - StampedLock

## Executors

- 从应用中分离出单独的线程管理和创建
- 封装线程的启动、执行和关闭的方法
- Executor Interfaces
- Thread Pools
  - 由worker threads组成
  - 减少新建线程的开销
  - *fixed thread pool*
    - 执行固定数量的线程
    - 应用可以优雅地降级
      - each HTTP request is handled by a separate thread
      - If the application simply creates a new thread for every new HTTP request, and the system receives more requests than it can handle immediately, the application will suddenly stop responding to all requests when the overhead of all those threads exceed the capacity of the system.
      - With a limit on the number of the threads that can be created, the application will not be servicing HTTP requests as quickly as they come in, but it will be servicing them as quickly as the system can sustain.	

## Fork/Join

- 实现ExecutorService

- 采用work-stealing
- 递归处理子任务
- ForkJoinPool
  - 实现work steling算法
  - 执行ForkJoinTask
